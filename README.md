# Excel_Inferential_statistics
Inferential Statistics for data-driven insights

## Project Overview

In today‚Äôs data-driven corporate environment, the ability to generate realistic data and apply statistical analysis is essential. This project, titled **"Inferential Statistics with Simulated Data"**, simulates a real-world scenario in which analysts work with a synthetic dataset to explore core statistical concepts and inferential techniques using **Microsoft Excel**. 

The fictional population of **Luggnagg** is used to generate data with controlled statistical properties. The workbook is structured into six interactive sheets that guide the user through the full analytical pipeline‚Äîfrom data generation to regression modeling.

## File Structure

### 1. `Parameters`
- **Purpose:** User inputs for defining the statistical parameters (mean, standard deviation, probability).
- **Features:** Clean and interactive layout with formatted headers and input cells.

### 2. `Data`
- **Purpose:** Generate 250 normally distributed ages and assign each person to a random group (1‚Äì4).
- **Columns:**
  - `Ages` (Normally distributed)
  - `Group` (Random integer between 1 and 4)

### 3. `Sample`
- **Purpose:** Filter data to extract a sample from a selected group using conditional logic.
- **Function Used:** `SE` (Excel‚Äôs `IF` statement).

### 4. `Statistical Insight`
- **Purpose:** Perform statistical analysis on the sampled data, including:
  - Expected Value (Mean)
  - Standard Deviation
  - Count
  - Confidence Interval
  - Estimation of the `p` parameter

- **Additional:** Includes explanatory text to interpret results.

### 5. `(Un)correlated Variables`
- **Purpose:** Add unrelated/random variables (e.g., number of cats, partner's age) and test for correlation.
- **Features:** Correlation coefficient calculation and interpretation.

### 6. `Linear Regression`
- **Purpose:** Perform a linear regression analysis using:
  - `Y`: Age
  - `X`: Census rank (row number)

- **Features:** Scatterplot with linear regression line; regression calculated specifically for participant #160.
